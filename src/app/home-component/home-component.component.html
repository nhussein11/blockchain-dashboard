                <strong>Blockchain defined: </strong>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the
                process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be
                tangible (a
                house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).
                Virtually
                anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs
                for
                all involved.

                <strong>Why blockchain is important: </strong>Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received
                and
                the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it
                provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that
                can
                be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments,
                accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can
                see
                all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies
                and
                opportunities.
